# Asheville_Urban_Renewal


The urban renewal project specific to Asheville took place betwee the 60's and the 90's. It most heavily impacted the neighborhod know as East Riverside. This neighborhood housed more than 50% of the city's African American residents. The city of Asheville used the power of eminent domain to uproot African American families and businesses, taking away homeownership, and affecting generational wealth. The residents and busineess owners were given money based on the apprasials of their properties, but in taking away their ownership of a home, the city also robbed them of the value of owning a home that can be passed down through families and create stability through generations.
